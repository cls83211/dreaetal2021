FCort_DC_vs_DT_Diff_a_source data.R [this has code to extract source data for figure]

Uses the data file: allpregcort_a.csv


nn_pub_code_anon.r

Uses the data file: nn_anaylsis_anon.rds

Serum_FAM_script - produces the results presented in Table S4: Status-related differences in the androgen concentrations of pregnant and postpartum meerkats.

Control_vs_Sub_Behaviour_Script -  produces the results presented in Table S5: Status-related differences in the behavior of pregnant and postpartum meerkats. 

Control_vs_Treated_Behaviour_Script - produces the results presented in Table S7: Effects of antiandrogen-treatment on the behavior of pregnant and postpartum, dominant meerkats. 

Subordinate_(Dominant_control_vs_treated)_Behaviour_Script - produces the results presented in Table S9: Effects of the matriarchâ€™s treatment condition on the behavior of pregnant and postpartum, subordinate meerkats. 

Offspring_script_a - produces Fig. 2 and the results presented in Table S3: Effects of mother and offspring age on offspring aggression.

nn_pub_code_anon - produces the results presented in Table S5: Effects of antiandrogen-treatment of dominant female meerkats on her dyadic rates of nearest-neighbour associations, per adult clan member, as measured by proximity scans.

All analyses were conducted in R - see manuscript for versions and packages used. All graphs in the manuscript apart from Fig. 2. were produced using GraphPad Prism 8. Fig. 2 was produced in R using ggplot2.
